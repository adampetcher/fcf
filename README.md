Foundational Cryptography Framework for machine-checked proofs of cryptography in the computational model.    

# Dependencies

Coq 8.6 or 8.5

# Building

`make` 

# Exploring 

Then open a simple example from the “src/examples” directory in Proof General.  A good place to start is “ElGamal.v.”  Interactively step through this proof to learn how to develop a simple proof of non-adaptive security in the concrete setting.  PRF_Encryption_IND_CPA.v contains a more complex proof of adaptive security along with a proof in the asymptotic setting.  


The publications describing FCF are available at adam.petcher.net.   

# Importing

  env COQPATH=/path/to/fcf/src proofgeneral test.v
  Require Import FCF.FCF.

# History

This repository used to contain a proof of security of ESPADA SSE Scheme under
`src/ESPADA`. This proof is no longer maintained; it is preserved in git
history.

Some files that no longer fully build are preserved under `src/FCF/Broken`.
There be dragons, though -- not all of them were ever finished, and some contain
significant `admit`s.
